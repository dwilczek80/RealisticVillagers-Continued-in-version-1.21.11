 * It matters most for the villages this plugin didn't design. A datapack's villages have their
 * own architecture, and there is otherwise no way to get it out of the world and into a menu:
 * you would have to rebuild each house by hand and save it with a structure block. Recording a
 * village you stumbled across is the difference between admiring somebody's work and being able
 * to use it.
 * <p>
 * Buildings are filed under the region they were found in, so a desert village's houses are
 * offered to desert villages and not to a taiga — the architecture stays where it belongs.
