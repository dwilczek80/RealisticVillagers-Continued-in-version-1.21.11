/**
 * Work that actually changes the world: felling trees and cutting cactus, and putting something
 * back each time.
 * <p>
 * Separate from {@link VillageEconomy} on purpose, and the two are not the same idea wearing
 * different hats. The economy credits a villager for its trade — the goods appear in the stores
 * and no block moves. This takes blocks out of the world and returns a sapling or a cactus in
 * their place, so a lumberjack thins the woods around a settlement over time and the woods grow
 * back. That is a thing a player can walk out and look at, which is the whole point of it.
 * <p>
 * <b>Still not a villager pathing to a tree and swinging an axe.</b> The worker has to be near
 * the tree it fells, so what happens is tied to where the villager actually is, but it does not
 * walk there on purpose — that needs behaviour at the AI level, in every version module. This is
 * the honest half that can be done without it: real blocks, real regrowth, tied to a real worker.
